# VagrantPress

*VagrantPress* is a packaged development environment for developing WordPress themes and plugins.  
[chadthompson] initially created this project to aid in developing child modules for a WordPress blog. I modified it to use a private ip (rather than a port), move WordPress into a subdirectory, and remove some components I didn't want/need.

## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  
The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (Thereâ€™s only master branch.)
2. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory
3. Open your browser to 10.231.31.31 (or whatever you set that to point to in your hosts file)

## Working with the environment

To log in to the local Wordpress installation:

`http://10.231.31.31/core/wp-admin/` the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

You can access phpMyAdmin:

`http://10.231.31.31/phpmyadmin/` with username `wordpress`, password `wordpress`.

## A Few Details

* If you're needing a password (for anything - including mysql, it should be `vagrant`)
